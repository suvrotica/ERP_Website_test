                    ERP is short for Enterprise Resource Planning. ERP is a software application that manages
                    and
                    integrates the data of an organization to provide it with a coherent digital representation.
                    ERP helps companies to automate the process of delivering and tracking orders, inventory,
                    production planning, etc.
                    ERP allows you to document and adhere to standard operating procedures in order to improve
                    efficiency by cutting down on human error. Enterprise resource planning software is a useful
                    tool for a company. It helps them to organize
                    and manage their business effectively.ERP is a software that is needed by any company that
                    deals
                    with manufacturing, distribution and
                    invoicing. ERP is a powerful tool because it integrates all the different aspects of the
                    business.
                    It allows companies to use resources in the most efficient way possible.
                    ERP is also one of the most complex software as its functionality varies from company to
                    company as itt helps manage all areas of a business such as finances, inventory management,
                    manufacturing,

                    Sherta has its focus trained on the fundamentals:
                    Traditionally, the silo nature of the functional organisational structure and the
                    cross-functional nature of the business processes were at odds with each other. The same
                    information was captured multiple times, in multiple places, and was not available in
                    real-time.
                    Viewing it from a process perspective requires the business to be viewed across functional
                    boundaries and focus on the end-to-end nature of the process and its intended outcomes. In
                    contemporary times, an organisation has to react quickly to changing market trends. To
                    survive,
                    thrive, and beat the competition, it has to manage the future. Managing the future is
                    managing
                    information. The organisation must be on its toes incessantly, gathering and analysing the
                    data—both in-house and from outside—acting and reacting in real time. The difference between
                    market leaders and laggards, between success and sickness, is the way in which companies
                    make
                    use of information. The business end-to-end processes that were traditionally disjointed can
                    now
                    share information through a common database. ERP technology, business process reengineering,

                    largely
